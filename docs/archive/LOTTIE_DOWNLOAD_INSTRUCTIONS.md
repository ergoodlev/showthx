## Important Tips

### What Makes a Good Frame Animation:
- ✅ Elements around the EDGES/CORNERS (not centered)
- ✅ Loops smoothly
- ✅ Not too busy (should complement video, not overwhelm)
- ✅ Appropriate for thank you videos (celebratory, happy, fun)

### What to AVOID:
- ❌ Centered icons with no border elements
- ❌ Full-screen overlays (we need see-through edges)
- ❌ Too many moving parts (should be decorative, not distracting)
- ❌ Dark or sad themes

---

## Alternative: Use Free Templates

If you can't find exact matches, these search terms often yield good frame animations:

- "photo frame animation"
- "video border animated"
- "decorative frame lottie"
- "celebration border"
- "kids frame animation"

**Any animation that decorates edges/corners works!**

---

## Verification

After downloading, run this command to check your files:

```bash
ls -la /Users/ericgoodlev/Desktop/GratituGram/assets/lottie/
```

You should see:
```
birthday-balloons.json
confetti-celebration.json
sparkle-stars.json
floating-hearts.json
fireworks-burst.json
rainbow-border.json
cute-dinosaurs.json
magic-unicorn.json
space-rockets.json

thank-you-sparkle.json
```
